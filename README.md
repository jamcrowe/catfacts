catfacts
========

This is a silly app I made at the Leeds Hack after me and my team failed horribly at our project.

It's a quick and dirty app that subscribes users to an sms service that spams them with facts about cats.

It uses the [MediaBurst API](http://www.mediaburst.co.uk/) to send and receive texts!
